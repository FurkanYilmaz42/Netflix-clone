## 📌 About the Project  
This project was created as my **first step into software development**, and it is built using only **HTML** and **CSS**.  
When you visit the site, you are greeted with a **sign-up form** where users can enter their email address and create an account.  
After that, the page provides important information about the project, such as the **devices it supports**, whether it is available **offline**, and if there is a **special profile** created for children.  
Finally, it includes a section for **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**.  

This is a **responsive** project, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.
